I contacted a tattoo shop to get an estimate on a small tattoo of my dog (sorry, mom!), when I noticed the tiniest, strange behavior in their site.

This tattoo portal had a slick, bootstrap portal to put in details about what you want done, and an artist from the shop would reply, etc. Here's my existing service request:

 ![Service Request]({{ site.base_url }}/existing-service-request.png)
 
Looks pretty benign, right? Well, there was something that tipped me off. Specifically, it was the link that I posted to a few reference images I wanted the artist to see:

![Image of Link Text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/link-test.png)

I know this is so minor, but the fact that the site didn't ingest my comment, identify the link, and then wrap it in a `<a>` (anchor) tag to make it click-able threw me off. That was enough to have me try one more, tiny test... Commenting with actual inline HTML. I added a simple `<b>t</b>` to another comment. 

![Bold T HTML]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bold-t-html.png)
![Bold T Proof]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bold-t-proof.png)

Okay, cool, so this site allows for at least basic [XSS (Cross Site Scripting)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/). The danger here is that I could theoretically inject arbitrary HTML (and therefore JavaScript) into the page. I could change the contents of the page whenever someone else loaded in (and ask them to re-enter their password), I could force users to download aribtrary files, I could even serve ads, or [mine cryptocurrency on their machine](https://github.com/rasinfosec/scripts/blob/master/miner.html).

I didn't want to do any other testing, as it would be annoying to the tattoo artist, and probably illegal [citation needed]. I figured it was a vulnerability in the web application, so I started looking to see if I could determine what framework they used. I navigated to their `/login` page, and opened up Chrome Dev Tools. Sometimes, if you're lucky, a server will announce itself here. We can see it's being run by Apache on an Ubuntu machine, but that's about it. I looked through the HTML in the DOM to see if there were any references to `wp-`, which is a tell-tale sign of WordPress, but again, no luck. 

![Headers]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/headers.png)

I finally began manually looking through the client-side JS, when I saw a reference to `bundle.js`. So at the time of writing this, I suspect they have a custom web application written for them. Nothing to do here but contact them, and let them know. I'm hoping that they'll give me an opportunity to do a simple XSS test that loads some JS that I'll host to really test it.
