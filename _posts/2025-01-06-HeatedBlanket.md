** This post is a WIP as I work through the project!**

Years ago, I bought a very cozy [heated blanket](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09QLKL82Q), that is, of course, internet connected. Why? Who doesn't want to be told they can't use their simple device [because of a forced firmware update](https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaregore/comments/7rsro4/fridge_decides_it_needs_an_update/). Anyway, I never thought too much of the device, and it's served me well all these years. Now, in my continued quest of "how lazy can I be?" I have decided that it is just *too* much effort to find the small control panel (it gets stuck behind the couch sometimes!) and turn on/off the blanket or fiddle with its temperature setting. After all, wouldn't it be more useful if I could just do it from my phone?

## Initial Poking Around

I connected the blanket to my WiFi via the [official app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sunbeambedding.app&hl=en_US), and then started pulling it apart in JADX. After a lot of CTRL+F'ing, I found some interesting keywords, namely "`listenUDP`", which looks like it starts up some socket for API calls (`TuyaNetworkInterface.listenUDP(6667);`). I did some more pivoting off that, by poking around the `TuyaNetworkInterface`, and then seeing that most of its implementation is in `TuyaNetworkApi`. The nice thing about `TuyaNetworkApi` is that it's actually defined in a shared-object file packaged with the app. I'm *much* more comfortable ripping apart some C code than I am Java (the [enterprise](https://github.com/Hello-World-EE/Java-Hello-World-Enterprise-Edition) format is an unfortunate blindspot in my reverse engineering skillset).

I'll start by figuring out which shared-object file in the APK exposes the functions in the `TuyaNetworkApi` class, by just `grep`'ing in the directory for a unique sounding function name (`encryptGcmDataForApConfigWithType` looks unique ðŸ™‚). You can see below I actually checked a few different function names, the first result came back with `libnetwork-android.so` which to me felt like a generic library, and not something specific to this app. So I tried a few different functions, and they all point to `libnetwork-android.so`, so let's open it up in Binary Ninja!

```bash
â•­â”€user@debian ~/Desktop/HeatedBlanket/decompiled/resources/lib/arm64-v8a
â•°â”€$ grep -lir 'encryptGcmDataForApConfigWithType' .
./libnetwork-android.so
â•­â”€user@debian ~/Desktop/HeatedBlanket/decompiled/resources/lib/arm64-v8a
â•°â”€$ grep -lir 'setHeartBeatResponseTimeout' .
./libnetwork-android.so
â•­â”€user@debian ~/Desktop/HeatedBlanket/decompiled/resources/lib/arm64-v8a
â•°â”€$ grep -lir 'enableDebug' .
./libTYAvLogSDK.so
./libnetwork-android.so
â•­â”€user@debian ~/Desktop/HeatedBlanket/decompiled/resources/lib/arm64-v8a
â•°â”€$ grep -lr 'sendCMD' .
./libnetwork-android.so
```

## JNI Reverse Engineering

I opened up the file in Binary Ninja, and searched for `Java_` in the symbols window, but didn't find what I expected. I know that JNI functions that auto-magically resolve should start with `Java_` followed by name of the Java package (delimeted by underscores rather than dots), but only two functions appear for this: `sendBroadcast` and `stopBroadcast`.

I expected to see the function names that I `grep`'ed for but they only exist in the shared-object as a string:
![JNI Expected Functions]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/HeatedBlanket//Expected%20Function.png)

I am vaguley familiar with the substrings in around the function name, it's the JNI Name Mangling (similar to C++'s mangling to encode return/parameter types). After ~~pouring through JNI internals for hours~~ finding a good [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55836885), I ~~realized~~ learned that I *also* have to track down the functions that are parsed in the `JNI_OnLoad` function. The StackOverflow post points to a [Java documentation page](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/functions.html#wp5833) that tells me I should interpret the memory in the previous image as an array of structures that gets passed to `RegisterNatives`, like so:

```c
typedef struct { 
    char *name; 
    char *signature; 
    void *fnPtr; 
} JNINativeMethod; 
```

So, I looked at the data structure to find the beginning of the array, and found it at `0x5f301`. Then I realized I can probably just get the address from whatever is passed into `RegisterNatives` (the signature takes a pointer to `JNINativeMethod[]`: `jint RegisterNatives(JNIEnv *env, jclass clazz, const JNINativeMethod *methods, jint nMethods);`). Of course though, it can't be that easy! The binary seems to be a little more complicated than boilerplate code, not obfuscated (unless you consider C++ obfuscation, in which case you might be onto something), just a lot. I found this useful [Android documentation page](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/perf-jni#native-libraries) which explains the usage of `RegisterNatives` a bit more, but unfortunately, it looks like our `JNI_OnLoad` function isn't getting any pretty resolution into what exactly is going on:

```c
uint64_t JNI_OnLoad(int64_t* arg1)
{
    int0_t tpidr_el0;
    uint64_t x21 = _ReadStatusReg(tpidr_el0);
    int64_t x8 = *(uint64_t*)(x21 + 0x28);
    char const* const x2_1;
    int64_t x4_1;
    
    if (!(*(uint64_t*)(*(uint64_t*)arg1 + 0x30))())
    {
        int64_t* var_40;
        
        if (!(*(uint64_t*)(*(uint64_t*)var_40 + 0x30))())
            goto label_373c4;
        
        if ((*(uint64_t*)(*(uint64_t*)var_40 + 0x6b8))())
        {
            x2_1 = "[%s:%d]Register Native Method Faâ€¦";
            x4_1 = 0x596;
            goto label_373c0;
        }
        
        data_7c3a0 = arg1;
        
        if (*(uint64_t*)(x21 + 0x28) == x8)
            return 0x10006;
    }
    else
    {
        x2_1 = "[%s:%d]JNI_OnLoad Failed";
        x4_1 = 0x58d;
        label_373c0:
        __android_log_print(6, "Tuya-Network", x2_1, "JNI_OnLoad", x4_1);
        label_373c4:
        
        if (*(uint64_t*)(x21 + 0x28) == x8)
            return 0;
    }
    __stack_chk_fail();
    /* no return */
}
```

Presumably, `arg1` is a pointer to the `JavaVM` structure, which makes `arg1+0x30` probably the `GetEnv` member (assuming that the structure in this [doc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/invocation.html) is correct) - which perfectly matches the Android documentation page. I found that the `JNIEnv*` (the output of `JavaVM->GetEnv`) is actually a typedef to `JNINativeInterface*`, which we can view [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/jni/functions.html#:~:text=The%20JNIEnv%20type%20is%20a,for%20future%20compatibility%20with%20COM). Assuming `var_40` in the above decompiled code is the `JNIEnv*` (I should probably actually get all this type resolution to work, but whatever), then `JNIEnv* + 0x30` is `FindClass` (score! This, again, matches the Android doc page), and `JNIEnv* + 0x6b8` is `SetFloatArrayRegion`, which ... doesn't sound right. On that page `RegisterNatives` would be `JNIEnv* + 0x6d0` which isn't too far off, and I'm willing to accept just a change in the header file (god knows how old this shared-object is).

At this point, I know I need to clean up the function, which means giving all of those `arg1` and `var_40` variables a real type. I googled around and found someone already made a [header file with JNI types](https://gist.github.com/Ayrx/5cd64657456468e97b284c35ab809579), so I was able to import that into Binary Ninja. Here is what the function looks like now:

```c
jint JNI_OnLoad(JavaVM* vm, void* reserved)
{
    int0_t tpidr_el0;
    uint64_t x21 = _ReadStatusReg(tpidr_el0);
    int64_t x8 = *(uint64_t*)(x21 + 0x28);
    JNIEnv* penv;
    char const* const x2_1;
    int64_t x4_1;
    
    if (!(*(uint64_t*)vm)->GetEnv(vm, &penv, &data_10006))
    {
        JNIEnv* env = penv;
        jclass clazz = (*(uint64_t*)env)->FindClass(env, "com/tuya/smart/android/device/Tuâ€¦");
        
        if (!clazz)
            goto label_373c4;
        
        JNIEnv* env_1 = penv;
        
        if ((*(uint64_t*)env_1)->RegisterNatives(env_1, clazz, &data_7c008, 0x20))
        {
            x2_1 = "[%s:%d]Register Native Method Faâ€¦";
            x4_1 = 0x596;
            goto label_373c0;
        }
        
        data_7c3a0 = vm;
        
        if (*(uint64_t*)(x21 + 0x28) == x8)
            return 0x10006;
    }
    else
    {
        x2_1 = "[%s:%d]JNI_OnLoad Failed";
        x4_1 = 0x58d;
        label_373c0:
        __android_log_print(6, "Tuya-Network", x2_1, "JNI_OnLoad", x4_1);
        label_373c4:
        
        if (*(uint64_t*)(x21 + 0x28) == x8)
            return 0;
    }
    __stack_chk_fail();
    /* no return */
}
```

Pretty nice! I should've done that from the start, but what can I say? I told you at the beginning I'm lazy ðŸ˜‰. Now, I was able to go back to the memory region that contained the `JNINativeMethod` array, and define it as such - it's *much* prettier.

### Understanding the Device Logic

Now that we have the core functionality of the device in front of us (well, I assume to be honest, this might be a red herring), let's actually go about and change the temperature of this blanket! The first function that jumped out at me was `sendCMD`. I'd love for this just to be some socket listening for JSON or something like that.
