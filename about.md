I'm Axel! I like working with computers, intelligence, and data. I especially like working with low-level computer security involving kernel and OS exploits. I thrive in fast-paced environments, highly technical work, solving challenging problems, and leading a teams of engineers discovering vulnerabilities, developing exploits, and authoring capabilities. 

I'm a co-founder of [nullptr security](https://nullptrsec.io); we focus on really hard problems in the cybersecurity world, and we guarantee happy results. Looking for work? See what we have on our [careers](https://nullptrsec.io/careers) page!

In the past, I have been called a security engineer, security analyst, software engineer, reverse-engineer, endpoint security consultant, and threat hunter. I value myself as a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none; I believe that my diverse technical background helps give me an edge to solving challenging problems.
