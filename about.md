I'm Axel! I like working with computers, intelligence, and data. I especially like working with low-level computer security involving kernel and OS exploits. I thrive in fast-paced environments, highly technical work, solving challenging problems, and leading a teams of engineers discovering vulnerabilities, developing exploits, and authoring capabilities. 

In the past, I have been called a security engineer, security analyst, software engineer, reverse-engineer, endpoint security consultant, and threat hunter. Now I'm a reverse-engineer (again!). I value myself as a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none; I believe that my diverse technical background helps give me an edge to solving challenging problems.
