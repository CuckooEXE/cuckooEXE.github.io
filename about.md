I like working with computers, intelligence, and data. I especially like working with low-level computer security involving kernel and OS exploits. In the past, I have been called a security engineer, security analyst, software engineer, reverse-engineer, endpoint security consultant, and threat hunter. Now I'm a reverse-engineer (again!).

### Technical Experience

Some of my work in the past includes writing an enterprise mail filter which was responsible for scanning all inbound emails for malware; kernel security modules; middleware software for security automation; documenting threat actor TTTPs (Tools, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures); hunting debriefs for senior executive leadership; exploit development and vulnerability research; developing novel hunt methods; developing malware to bypass EDR/AV; research Windows kernel structures for functionality; and much more.
