I love working with computers, and I love breaking computers even more. I work as an independent security researcher where people pay me to hack their products, so I can help them fix it before attackers take advantage. I love the work, and I love making things more secure. I also like buying silly IoT devices and hacking them too for practice. On this blog, you'll find random write-ups at random intervals. If you ever have any questions about any of the content on my blog, feel free to reach out!
