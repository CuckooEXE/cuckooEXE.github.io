Below is a list of CVEs that I have authored, or assisted in developing:

- **[CVE-2021-27569](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27569)**: An issue was discovered in Emote Remote Mouse through 3.015. Attackers can maximize or minimize the window of a running process by sending the process name in a crafted packet. This information is sent in cleartext and is not protected by any authentication logic.
- **[CVE-2021-27570](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27570)**: An issue was discovered in Emote Remote Mouse through 3.015. Attackers can close any running process by sending the process name in a specially crafted packet. This information is sent in cleartext and is not protected by any authentication logic.
- **[CVE-2021-27571](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27571)**: An issue was discovered in Emote Remote Mouse through 3.015. Attackers can retrieve recently used and running applications, their icons, and their file paths. This information is sent in cleartext and is not protected by any authentication logic.
- **[CVE-2021-27572](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27572)**: An issue was discovered in Emote Remote Mouse through 3.015. Authentication Bypass can occur via Packet Replay. Remote unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary code via crafted UDP packets even when passwords are set.
- **[CVE-2021-27573](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27573)**: An issue was discovered in Emote Remote Mouse through 3.015. Remote unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary code via crafted UDP packets with no prior authorization or authentication.
- **[CVE-2021-27574](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-27574)**: An issue was discovered in Emote Remote Mouse through 3.015. It uses cleartext HTTP to check, and request, updates. Thus, attackers can machine-in-the-middle a victim to download a malicious binary in place of the real update, with no SSL errors or warnings.
